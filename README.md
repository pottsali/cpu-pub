# MUPS/16 Homebrew CPU project

This is public repo for files from the MUPS/16 homebrew CPU project. Please see http://mups16.net for details.

## Files

### Schematics
Currently I've only uploaded the schematics for the PCBs here, and will add more as I complete the last few bits. Most of the schematics are documented on the MUPS/16 [website](http://mups16.net).

### Others
I have a few other sets of files to clean up and upload:
 - A gate-level simulation of the whole system in [Digital](https://github.com/hneemann/Digital) format
 - Microcode generation, for the control ROMs
 - An assembler
 - A very basic monitor to test the system
 
These are not yet in a fit state to upload, but I will add them as I clean them up.
